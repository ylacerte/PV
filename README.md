# PV

NREL's PVWattsÂ® (https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/) estimates the energy production of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) energy systems based on a few simple inputs. 

An alternative to PVWatts is Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS) (https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/photovoltaic-geographical-information-system-pvgis_en). PVGIS provides information on solar radiation and photovoltaic system performance for any location in the world, except the North and South Poles. PVGIS is also accessible via API. 

Herein are two R flexdashboards that access each API.
